    "`numpy` and `pandas` are two essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "`numpy` provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a \n",
    "collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays in an efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` builds on top of numpy to provide some additional functionality and user-friendliness. It also provides data structures like `DataFrames`, which are more flexible than `numpy` arrays and can handle heterogeneous data types (similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table)."
